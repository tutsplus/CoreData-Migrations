### Tuts+ Tutorial: Core Data from Scratch: Migrations

#### Instructor: Bart Jacobs

In the previous articles of this series,  we've encountered an annoying issue that we need to address. Whenever we modify the data model of a Core Data application, the persistent store becomes incompatible with the data model. The result is a crash on launch, rendering the application unusable, a serious problem if this happens to an application in the App Store. In this article, we aim to solve this issue by leveraging Core Data migrations.
